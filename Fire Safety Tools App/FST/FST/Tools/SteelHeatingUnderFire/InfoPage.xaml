The temperature endpoint criteria cited by ISO 834 are often accepted as the critical temperatures in Europe."/>

            <Label Text="This model can be used in many engineering applications; the use of this model depends on purpose of calculations and should be used when no extra information of the fire is available. The main characteristics of this model are: the fire is assumed to be active within the whole compartment (even if the compartment is huge), independent of the actual size of this compartment; the fire never decays, not even after all combustible materials have been exhausted; it does not depend on the compartment's fire load nor on ventilation conditions" />
